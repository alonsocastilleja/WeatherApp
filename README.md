## Weather app using Express and ejs

I built an app that allows you to lookup the weather of any city. You simply type in the name of the desired city and press Enter. The end result is the weather outlook of that city.

## Getting Started 

You can either clone or download the repository to your local machine. Once you have the files, you need to install the dependencies by typing 'npm i' on your command line.

## Starting The Server

You can start running the server by typing 'node app' into your command line tool.

## Stopping The Server

In order to stop the server from running, you can type 'control + c' on your command line tool.

## Built With
* [Node] - Server-side development

* [Express] - Used to create my API endpoints.
